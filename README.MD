# My soon to be Portofolio
## Work under Construction

This website was made from a template donwloaded on html5up.net

I have updated most of the anchor tags in HTML, deleted some divs that I did not need, changed some of the CSS styles and the profile pictures.

I have linked my resume as a PDF and made some other changes like making the contacts responsible (mail to, tel, github).

Still need to work on the form (formspree.io a try)

And of course having some real work to showcase

PS: Not sure how to get that contact form working? Give formspree.io a try (it's awesome).
